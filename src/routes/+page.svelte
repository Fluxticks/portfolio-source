			<p>
				This was my first Freelance Front-End project. I used this project to learn the basics of
				HTML, CSS, JS as well as React.
			</p>
			<p>
				The design process stretched over a period of 6 months. The client and I settled on an Agile
				design process, meeting often to iterate on the conceptual design. After which I started the
				implementation process, continuing an Agile interaction with the client until the product
				reached the clients expectations.

			<p>
				During my 3 years at University I was an active member of the Esports and Gaming society,
				primarily in the Esports sector. Once I became a committee member I was faced with issues
				due to the lack of any automation. Because of this I took on the existing <a
					href="https://discord.com/company">Discord</a
				> bot and contributed to the project to get a production-ready bot that is still in use today.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later after the release of <a
					href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ"
					>Discord's slash-commands</a
				>, I rewrote the bot from scratch to implement the new protocols as well as rework much of
				the logic to result in a much more consistent bot.

			languages="Python / PyPI / Playwright"
		>
			<p>
				TikTok's official API is extremely limited and thus did not allow the accessing of videos
				while not logged in. Due to this I created a simple python package using Playwright to
				access TikTok and download a post's media content and metadata. While debugging I
				encountered multiple captchas, which get solved automatically using openCV and some basic
				image processing techniques included in openCV.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was also my first successful attempt at deploying a python package to <a
					href="https://pypi.org/project/tiktok-dlpy/">PyPI</a
				>.

			<p>
				Similar to my other project, TikTokDL, InstagramDL allows someone to download an Instagram
				post and the metadata without needing to login. This project makes use of capturing the HTTP
				requests that are sent to intercept the video for a given link.

				After learning the basics of Front-End development and experimenting with different
				frameworks such as NextJS, Svelte and also basic HTML/JS/CSS.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being my own client, the biggest challenge to building the site was finding a design that
				looked good and was efficient that I liked. Once I found a design I liked, I decided to use
				SvelteKit and the StaticAdapter preprocessor to generate a static site that can be hosted on
				github pages. This resulted in the current site that is being displayed as my <a
					href="https://fluxticks.github.io">github.io</a
				> site.
